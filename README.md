# CtCI Solutions

This repository will contain Python solutions to the problems in the sixth
edition of
[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
by [Gayle Lackmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/).
Note that [many other solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition)
are available from CareerCup.

Problems 4 and 8 from chapter 7 are particularly noteworthy.
Problem 4 allows you to park cars, and problem 8 provides a simple Othello bot.
You can play against the Othello bot with `python 08-othello.py play`.
Good luck!
